        <h1 style="color:lime; background-color:blue;"> Update 1.0.0 offical release (1.00) </h1>
        <p style="color:lime"> This is a <b>HUGE</b> version as this indicates the inital release of Bolt. this contains all the current features from the ban/boot command all away to the tesla commands. We cannot really call this a update as there was nothing to update in the begining. It is estimated that Bolt first released on 7/27/2020 (COVID-19 coronavirus <- memmory of INSANE times. Because that is the day Bolt was released to the public, that is also the date that 'update' 1.0.1 offical release. at first I knew nothing about coding a bot but now I'm pretty solid at making discord bots. It was a TON of fun making the bot because it taught me alot about javascript and how to make a bot</p>
